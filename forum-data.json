    "description": "Hello everyone. I’m currently juggling student loans and trying to establish some financial stability. I’ve heard mixed advice—some say I should focus entirely on paying off my loans, while others recommend building an emergency fund first. My loan interest rate is 5%, and I can afford to put aside $300 a month. Should I split it between loans and savings, or prioritize one over the other?",

        "reply": "Hi. From my experience, it's usually a good idea to have at least a small emergency fund, maybe 3 months' worth of essential expenses, before aggressively tackling your loans. An emergency fund can save you from needing to rely on credit cards or other high-interest debt if unexpected costs come up. Once you have that cushion, you can focus more on your loans. Since your interest is 5%, it's also worth considering putting any extra money into loan payments if you already feel comfortable with your savings buffer. Hope this helps!",
